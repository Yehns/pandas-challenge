Analysis of Available Data
Analysis of Results**

The provided school data offers insight into the performance of government and independent schools and the associated students. The data containing over 36,000 student entries can be refined to pull key identifiers to the academic performance and financial considerations.

The data reveals a total of 15 schools with a combined budget of over $24 million, maintaining a consistent average score for mathematics at 70.3% and an average reading score of 70%. A comfortable majority of students are passing both subjects representing  83.5% of the given population.

When investigating the performance of each school individually, key details can be extrapolated from budget data. The total budget, and total amount of students can be divided and compared to determine a per-student budget. This value ranges from $578 to $655 per student, with no clear outliers between government and independent schools. The school with the lowest population is Holden High School maintains a student population of 427 and $582 per student, and the highest is Bailey High School with 4976 students and a per-student budget of $628. 
Although Bailey High School maintains a higher student body, it should not be concluded a correlation exists between student budget and student population, as Rodriguez high School maintains fewer students, with a greater per-student budget of $637. 

The top performing schools can be quickly identified through the data, with Griffin High School ranking at the highest, with an overall passing rate for reading and math at 88.2%, followed closely by Cabrera High School with 87.8% and Bailey High School with 87.7%.  Of the top five performing schools in the district, four are independent and only one is a government school. For the top-performing schools the highest student count is 1,858, and the lowest is 427. When comparing the results to the lowest performing schools, the worst performer is Hernandez High School, with an overall pass rate for reading and math at 79.7%, followed by Huang High School at 80%.

 The student population of the lowest-performing schools are vastly different to the top performers. Ranging from 2,283 to 4,635 students. It can be stated that lower-performing schools have a greater student population than high-performing schools as the results are conssiten with the 5 highest and lowest performing schools. 

When looking at the grade performance of schools for math, clear indicators can be drawn for the performance from year 9 to 12 within 4 years. When investigating the performance of mathematics at every school, results do not differ beyond a 3% increase or decrease in years 9 to 12. The starting and ending average from Year 9 to 12 can be investigated for each school to determine performance.
 
The student performance in mathematics remains relatively consistent and should focus on the school type. Bailey High School indicated, an independent school, maintains a high constant math grade. In Year 9, the average was 72.49% and in Year 12, 72.68%, this 0.19% decrease is small and indicates the constant performance of independent schools in maths scores at a highger rate to lower poperforming schools. The same ananlysis can be given for Griffin High School, which maintains an average of 71% in maths between Year 9 to 12, decreaing by 2.6%. As for the lowest performing school, Hernandez High School (which is government led), the average math grade in Year 9 is 68.69%, and in Year 12, 68.99%. Although the average has increased by 0.44%, the overall average within each year is lower than that of Bailey High School. When focusiong on the average reading scores, Bailey High School (independant) remains a high performer with an average increase of 1.3% in reading grades for students from year 9 to Year 12. And Hernandez High School (governmetn) with an increase of 0.76% from Year 9 to  Year 12. 

The results further reveal that government schools operate at a lower efficiency than independent schools, maintaining lower student populations and yielding improved education performance indicators. School budget should not be a primary identifier of school performance, but the school type and student population.
